META-DESCRIPTION

1. This will be a column added to the database for product and product description
	a. Create a migration for products and add meta_description.
	b. Create a column called data, make it a string and make it nullable
	c. Migrate it.
2. Put this field in the Admin tool when one can add a new product
	a. Go to the view in the Admin tool where adding a product is
	b. Create a new field and call it meta-description
3. Put this field in the Admin tool when one can edit a product
	a. Go to the view in the Admin tool where adding a product is
	b. Create a new field and call it meta-description
	c. Put as the value $product->meta_description
4. Go to the store or save function for a product and add that to what is saved
	a. Go to the product controller
	b. Go to the save section and add that to the data that saves
5. Go to the update function for a product and add that to what is saved
	a. Go to the product controller
	b. Go to the update section and add that to the data that update
6. On the product page, create an IF statement where if a meta-description for that product does NOT exist, it will get it from the page.
   This is because if there is one in the database, we want to get the meta description from there and not the page itself. The else statement
   will be that it gets it from the page.

REPEAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS WITH PRODUCT CATEGORIES
